# Quill Image Uploader
    A quilljs plugin that allows you to upload the following type of images directly to your backend:
* images drag/dropped into the editor
* images inserted using the toolbar
* images copy/pasted from the clipboard

## Usage: WIP

## Inspiration
    This library is a typescript port of [quill-image-uploader](https://github.com/NoelOConnell/quill-image-uploader). It seems the package is currently not maintained.
